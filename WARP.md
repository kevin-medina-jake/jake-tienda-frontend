# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Jake Tienda Electrónica is a Next.js 15 e-commerce application for an electronic/audio equipment store in Colombia. The application features product browsing, filtering, shopping cart functionality, and payment integration with PayU.

## Development Commands

### Core Development
```bash
# Development with Turbopack (faster builds)
npm run dev

# Alternative package managers
bun dev
yarn dev
pnpm dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Generate sitemap after build
npm run postbuild
```

### Data Management
```bash
# Fetch Colombian location data (departments/cities)
bun run prepare:co-data
```

### State Management Architecture
The application uses Zustand for state management with two main stores:

**Products Store** (`src/store/products.ts`):
- Manages product filtering (search, categories, brands, price)
- Handles product lists and filtered results
- Loading states for async operations

**Shopping Cart Store** (`src/store/shopping-cart.ts`):
- Persistent shopping cart using local storage
- Add/remove products, quantity management
- Calculate totals and product counts

### API Integration

- **Internal APIs**: Next.js API routes in `/src/app/api/` for:
  - Product search and filtering
  - PayU payment integration


### Key Features
- **Product Filtering**: Advanced filtering by categories, brands, price with real-time results
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart with local storage, quantity management
- **Search**: Product search with debounced input
- **Payment**: PayU gateway integration for Colombian market
- **SEO**: Comprehensive metadata, sitemap generation, structured data
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS

## Development Guidelines

### Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are configured:

- PayU payment gateway credentials (for payment features)

### Component Organization
- Components are organized by feature/page in `/src/components/`
- Shared components go in `/src/components/common/`
- Each component directory contains related components for that feature

### API Routes Pattern

- PayU integration in `/src/app/api/payu/`

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript types in `/src/types/`
- Product types include filtering, cart, and display variants


### State Management Pattern
- Use Zustand hooks for global state
- Persist cart state to localStorage
- Filter state is ephemeral (session-based)

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS 4 with custom animations
- Prettier with tailwindcss plugin for class sorting
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

## Testing and Quality

### Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Build Validation
```bash
npm run build
```
Note: TypeScript and ESLint errors are ignored during builds (`ignoreBuildErrors: true`)

### Code Formatting
Uses Prettier with Tailwind CSS plugin for consistent formatting.
